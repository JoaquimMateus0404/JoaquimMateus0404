### Hi there 👋
# Joaquim Duarte Mateus

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋

## About Me
I am Duarte Gauss, a young student majoring in Management Informatics, passionate about information technology, software development, and everything related to the vast world of programming. With a curious and inquisitive mind, I am constantly seeking to enhance my skills and explore new technologies. In addition to my academic studies, I have been involved in freelance projects, applying my knowledge in a practical manner and gaining valuable experience in the real-world field of software development.

## 💡 More About Me
Always in pursuit of stimulating challenges, I have dedicated myself to developing innovative solutions. My areas of interest include mobile app development, exploring advanced data mining techniques, and creating robust software. Furthermore, I possess strong skills in .NET (C#), Java, and Laravel, and I am always open to collaborations on projects involving artificial intelligence and machine learning. If you are seeking an enthusiastic and committed developer, I am here to contribute and learn alongside the community.

## 🔭 Currently Working On

- Currently, I am focused on the development of an exciting project called EcoSolution. This project is a mobile application aimed at environmental awareness. The main goal is to encourage users to adopt more sustainable and environmentally friendly habits, and I am committed to creating an innovative solution that meets the needs of the end user. Additionally, I am exploring the integration of technologies such as ChatGPT to enhance the efficiency and functionality of the project.

- This project not only challenges my technical skills but also provides me with the opportunity to apply concepts learned in my Management Informatics course in a practical setting. I am excited about the results we can achieve and look forward to sharing more details soon. Stay tuned for updates on this exciting work in progress! 👨‍💻✨
